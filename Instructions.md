How to put forms which send emails on action into static sites without redirect

## step 1 - make a simple html form.

```html
<form>
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="firstname"><br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## step 2 - make a google form with the same fields

## step 3 - We need to know what google calls these fields.  Make a pre-filed form, fill with anything, and grab the link.

```

## step 4 - use the entry fields from the pre-filled link for your form name/ids, and set the action to direct to your google form.  Also add some hidden_iframes, this is used to block the redirect. Don't forget change the final link from viewform? to formResponse?

```html
<form name="gform" id="gform" enctype="text/plain" action="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14lh6MIQOy9j3jWzEl7BysxEe4p9OoU9WN3tytbQjj1I/formResponse?" target="hidden_iframe" onsubmit="submitted=true;">
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="entry.810989529" id="entry.810989529"><br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="entry.463380756" id="entry.463380756">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<iframe name="hidden_iframe" id="hidden_iframe" style="display:none;" onload="if(submitted) {}"></iframe>
```

## step 5 - add some javascript to keep track of what happens after a submit

```html
<script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">var submitted=false;</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
$('#gform').on('submit', function(e) {
  $('#gform *').fadeOut(2000);
  $('#gform').prepend('Your submission has been processed...');
  });
</script>
```

That's it.  You now have an html form that upon submit completes the google form (which can easily be set up to populate a spreadsheet and/or email you), but DOES NOT REDIRECT, instead just fades away and is replaces with a friendly message.

## demo :
Here is some demo shots from a website I'm making:

Here's just an empty form with some css styling...

You fill it out with whatever ...

The user sees just this upon submit...

This is what it looks like in my response spreadsheet...
